# Parent Page: Form Section HTML

This HTML should replace the existing copy in the FORM + EMBEDDED ACTIVE CAMPAIGN section on your parent page (wunderbardigital.com).

## Updated Form Section

Replace your existing copy in the FORM + EMBEDDED ACTIVE CAMPAIGN section with this:

```html
<section class="bs-section bs-form-section" id="full-report">
  <div class="bs-container">
    <h2 class="bs-h2">Get Your Complete WunderBrand Snapshot™ Report</h2>

    <p class="bs-sub">
      Your personalized report includes insights for all five pillars, your biggest opportunities, 
      and high-impact next steps to strengthen your brand.
    </p>

    <p class="bs-sub">
      Enter your details below and I'll send your full WunderBrand Snapshot™ straight to your inbox.
    </p>

    <div class="mt-6">
      <!-- Your existing ActiveCampaign embedded form stays exactly as it is -->
      <!-- No changes required inside the <form> tag -->
      <!-- (the form HTML you already have goes here unchanged) -->
      <!-- Opt-in microcopy already included -->
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

## Notes

- Keep your existing ActiveCampaign form HTML unchanged
- Only replace the copy/text above the form
- The form submission will capture email and name, then trigger the save/sync process
- The `id="full-report"` can be used for scrolling/anchor links

## Micro-copy (Recommended)

Below the form, include this opt-in microcopy (if not already in your AC form):

```html
<p class="bs-microcopy">
