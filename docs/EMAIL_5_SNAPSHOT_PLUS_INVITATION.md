Hi %firstname%,

Now that you've had a little time to review your Brand Snapshot™ results — including your Brand Alignment Score™ of %BRAND_ALIGNMENT_SCORE% and how you performed across the five pillars — you're in a perfect position to take the next step.

What you received in the free Snapshot is the baseline.
But there's far more depth available once we analyze your brand on a strategic level.

This is where Snapshot+™ comes in.

Snapshot+™ builds on your existing results and gives you:

✨ A deeper diagnostic across all five pillars
✨ A detailed breakdown of opportunities specific to your brand
✨ Clear recommendations that strengthen trust, clarity, and consistency
✨ A personalized action plan you can hand off to your team
✨ A full PDF you can use internally or with stakeholders

If you found your initial results helpful, Snapshot+™ will give you the clarity and direction to move forward with confidence.

If you have questions or want to talk through what you'd receive, reply here — I'm happy to help.

Warmly,
Claudine
Founder, Wunderbar Digital

## Personalization Notes
