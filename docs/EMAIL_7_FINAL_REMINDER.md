## Email Body

Hi %firstname%,

I hope your WunderBrand Snapshot™ has given you meaningful clarity on how your brand is showing up today. You now have a strong foundation — and a better understanding of what's working and where refinement will strengthen your presence.

Before we close this sequence, I wanted to give you one last opportunity to upgrade to Snapshot+™.

It's the most complete view of your brand's clarity, consistency, and strategic opportunities — and it builds directly on the results you've already unlocked.

Snapshot+™ includes:

• A deeper five-pillar analysis
• Expanded insights for your lowest-scoring pillar (%WEAKEST_PILLAR%)
• Actionable recommendations tailored to your goals
• A beautifully designed PDF you can use with stakeholders
• A clear, prioritized roadmap to strengthen your brand

If now's not the right time, that's completely okay.

But if you do want deeper clarity, you won't find a faster or more supportive way to get it.

👉 Upgrade to Snapshot+™
[Upgrade to Snapshot+™ →]

Warmly,
Claudine

## Personalization Notes

- Replace `%firstname%` with contact's first name
