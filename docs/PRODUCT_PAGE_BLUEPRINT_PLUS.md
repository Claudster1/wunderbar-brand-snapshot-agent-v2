## Why Blueprint+ Exists

WunderBrand Blueprint™ gives you the operating system. WunderBrand Blueprint+™ **makes it impossible not to execute.**

Every recommendation comes with a template. Every strategy comes with step-by-step instructions. Every section comes with ready-to-use copy. Plus: estimated business impact for every pillar, audience-specific messaging variations, a week-by-week 90-day plan, a content calendar, 12 additional advanced AI prompts, and a live 30-minute strategy session with a brand strategist from Wunderbar Digital.

Blueprint+ is for businesses that don't just want to know what to do — they want to be handed the tools to do it, with expert guidance to make sure they get it right.

---

## Everything in WunderBrand Blueprint™, Plus:

---

### 1. AI-Informed Industry Benchmarks
**What it is:** The deepest level of benchmarking available — your WunderBrand Score™ and pillar scores compared against AI-informed industry intelligence, with context on what top-performing brands in your space typically score, where the biggest gaps exist, and how your performance stacks up against common patterns in your industry.

**Why it matters:** At this tier, you're not just getting directional context — you're getting the richest available picture of where you stand. AI-informed intelligence provides strategic context based on broad market patterns, so you can see where you lead and where you're falling behind.

**How it helps your business:** Set ambitious but realistic goals. Know where you're leading your market and where you're trailing. Make investment decisions based on a clear picture of your competitive landscape.

**What you'll see:** Comprehensive benchmarking with AI-informed industry context and strategic implications for each pillar.

---

### 2. Brand Health Scorecard & Unlimited Quarterly Refreshes
**What it is:** Two things working together:
1. **Brand Health Scorecard** — A structured measurement framework with metrics for each pillar, green/yellow/red thresholds, and a step-by-step quarterly review process so you always know where your brand stands.
2. **Unlimited Quarterly Refreshes (Blueprint+ Exclusive)** — Retake the WunderBrand Snapshot™ assessment every quarter at no additional cost. Your dashboard shows a live score trend chart with your WunderBrand Score™ and all five pillar scores over time, so you can see exactly what's improving, what's declining, and what needs attention.

**Why it matters:** Your WunderBrand Score™ is a snapshot in time. Quarterly refreshes turn it into a trend. Are your improvements compounding? Is a pillar backsliding? Are new initiatives moving the needle? Without systematic tracking, you'll never know. Blueprint+ is the only tier where quarterly refreshes are included free — Snapshot+ and Blueprint customers pay $47 and $97 per refresh, respectively.

**How it helps your business:** Turn brand strategy from a one-time project into an ongoing competitive advantage. Retake the assessment quarterly, compare against your baseline on your dashboard, and adjust your strategy based on what the data tells you. This is how the best brands stay the best.

**What you'll see:** A structured scorecard template with metrics for each pillar, quarterly tracking columns, and interpretation guidance — plus a live score trend chart on your dashboard that updates every time you complete a new assessment.

---

### 3. SWOT Analysis (Calibrated to Your Diagnostic Data)
**What it is:** A Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis — but not the kind you brainstorm on a whiteboard. Every item is grounded in your actual assessment data:
- **Strengths** are pulled from your highest-scoring pillars and the specific elements driving those scores
- **Weaknesses** are connected to your lowest-scoring pillars and the specific gaps identified
- **Opportunities** are derived from market context, underserved audience needs, and competitive whitespace
- **Threats** are flagged from risk-of-inaction analysis and common competitive pressures in your industry

**Why it matters:** Generic SWOT exercises produce generic insights. A data-calibrated SWOT produces strategic intelligence you can act on. Every entry traces back to something measurable in your diagnostic.

**How it helps your business:** Pull this out in board meetings, investor conversations, or strategic planning sessions. Data-backed SWOT carries weight that whiteboard guesses don't. It also gives you a structured framework for evaluating new opportunities and threats as they emerge.

**What you'll see:** A complete SWOT matrix with data-backed entries and strategic implications for each item.

---

### 4. Voice of Customer (VOC) Brand Perception Survey
**What it is:** A built-in tool to gather real feedback from your customers — send a 2-minute survey to 5–10 of your real clients or customers to collect their honest perception of your brand. Responses are AI-analyzed and integrated into your report, surfacing:
- **Recommendation Likelihood** — How likely your customers are to recommend you, and what that signals about brand loyalty
- **Perception Gaps** — Where your customers' actual experience differs from your intended brand message
- **Blind Spots** — What your customers see that you might be missing entirely
- **Strengths Customers See** — What you're doing right that you may be undervaluing or under-promoting
- **Discovery Channels** — How your customers actually found you (which often contradicts assumptions)

**Why it matters:** This is the only section of your report powered by **real external data from real people**. Every other section is based on your assessment answers and AI analysis. The VOC survey adds the outside perspective — and that perspective is often surprising. The gap between "what we think our brand communicates" and "what our customers actually experience" is where some of the biggest strategic opportunities live.

**How it helps your business:** You'll discover whether your brand promise matches your customer experience. If customers love your service but can't explain what you do, your Messaging pillar needs work. If they found you through referrals but you're investing in paid ads, your Visibility strategy may need adjustment. Real customer data replaces assumptions with evidence — and gives your strategy a foundation that AI analysis alone cannot provide.

**What you'll see:** A shareable survey link, with AI-analyzed results that integrate directly into your report alongside your diagnostic data. Your report also includes a recommendation to implement a formal Net Promoter Score (NPS) program — with setup guidance, question templates, and benchmarks — so you can track customer loyalty at scale over time.

> *Note: The VOC survey is optional but highly recommended. You can send it before or after receiving your report — results are integrated as responses come in. Minimum 3 responses needed for meaningful analysis. The VOC survey provides directional customer insight — for statistically valid measurement, we recommend implementing the NPS program described in your report.*

### 5. Enhanced Pillar Deep Dives — Estimated Business Impact & Financial Framing
**What it is:** Every pillar analysis from Blueprint is expanded with:
- **Estimated Business Impact** — Directional financial framing showing what fixing this gap could be worth to your business, using industry-typical impact ranges (e.g., "Businesses that improve their Messaging pillar from your current score range to 15+ typically see 20–35% shorter sales cycles")
- **Illustrative 12-Month Impact Scenarios** — What happens if you act vs. what happens if you don't, projected across a 12-month timeline
- **Multi-Channel Before & After Examples with Copy** — Not just one example, but examples across website, email, and social media — with actual copy you can adapt
- **Step-by-Step Implementation Guides** — Each recommendation comes with a numbered action sequence, timeline, and checklist
- **Ready-to-Use Templates** — Fill-in-the-blank templates for the most common implementation tasks (headline formulas, testimonial placement checklists, CTA audit frameworks, etc.)

**Why it matters:** Blueprint tells you what to do. Blueprint+ tells you what it's worth, shows you what happens if you don't, gives you examples across every channel, hands you the step-by-step instructions, and provides the templates to execute.

**How it helps your business:** No more "great strategy, now what?" Every recommendation comes with a financial case (to justify the investment), a timeline (to create urgency), examples (to show what good looks like), instructions (to remove guesswork), and templates (to save time).

**What you'll see:** Extended pillar sections with financial framing, impact scenarios, multi-channel examples, implementation guides, and downloadable templates.

> *Note: Business impact estimates are directional ranges based on typical industry patterns and AI analysis — not projections based on your specific financials. They're designed to frame the strategic value of each improvement, not to guarantee specific revenue outcomes.*

---

### 6. Brand Personality Activation — Full Playbook (Messaging, Content, Sales, Visuals)
**What it is:** A comprehensive activation playbook that shows how to bring your archetype system to life across four domains:
- **Messaging Playbook** — Tone, language choices, phrasing patterns, emotional triggers, and vocabulary for your archetype
- **Content Playbook** — Topics, formats, creative angles, and content styles that align with your personality
- **Sales Playbook** — Conversation frameworks, objection handling approaches, pitch structures, and relationship-building tactics that match your archetype
- **Visual Playbook** — Imagery direction, photography style, mood, graphic design principles, and visual storytelling approaches

**Why it matters:** Blueprint gave you an activation guide. Blueprint+ gives you four full playbooks — one for every domain where your brand personality needs to show up. This is the difference between "understand your archetype" and "live your archetype in every interaction."

**How it helps your business:** Your archetype becomes a competitive weapon across every touchpoint. Marketing feels authentic because it IS authentic — it's systematically aligned to your brand's natural personality.

**What you'll see:** Four domain-specific playbooks, each with principles, examples, and practical guidance.

---

### 7. Communication Guidelines — Audience-Specific Variations
**What it is:** Expanded Do's and Don'ts with variations for each of your key audience segments — how your tone, examples, vocabulary, and emphasis should shift when speaking to different customer profiles while maintaining your core brand identity.

**Why it matters:** You don't talk to a CTO the same way you talk to a founder. You don't talk to an enterprise buyer the same way you talk to a solopreneur. But you should always sound like your brand. These variations give you the flexibility to adapt without losing coherence.

**How it helps your business:** Sound consistent AND relevant to every audience. Your enterprise communication has appropriate gravitas. Your SMB communication has appropriate accessibility. Both unmistakably sound like your brand.

**What you'll see:** Audience-specific communication guidelines for each of your ICPs, with examples showing the same message adapted for different audiences.

---

### 8. Differentiation — AI-Informed Competitor Contrast Positioning
**What it is:** A differentiation narrative that directly contrasts your brand against competitive alternatives — with specific language for how to position yourself in sales conversations, proposals, marketing copy, and comparison pages.

**Why it matters:** "We're the best" doesn't work. Prospects have specific alternatives they're considering. Contrast positioning gives you defensible, specific claims that explain why you're the right choice vs. the other options — without being negative or defensive.

**How it helps your business:** Win competitive deals with language that addresses the prospect's actual alternatives. When a prospect says "We're also talking to [competitor]," you'll have a prepared, strategic response.

**What you'll see:** A contrast positioning document with specific language for differentiation against competitive alternatives.

> *Note: Competitor analysis is AI-informed based on publicly available information. For competitors the AI has extensive knowledge about, the analysis will be specific. For smaller or local competitors, the analysis may be more directional — we recommend validating specific claims.*

---

### 9. Brand Growth & Expansion Strategy
**What it is:** A strategic framework for how your brand can expand into new products, services, markets, or audience segments while maintaining coherence, trust, and the brand equity you've built.

**Why it matters:** Growth breaks brands. New offerings create confusion if they're not architecturally connected to your core identity. A new product line, a new market entry, or a new service tier can either strengthen your brand or dilute it — depending on whether the expansion is strategic.

**How it helps your business:** Scale without losing your soul. Launch new products that strengthen your brand instead of diluting it. Enter new markets with a clear connection to your core identity. This framework prevents the most common growth mistake: expanding too broadly, too fast, without strategic coherence.

**What you'll see:** A brand architecture framework with expansion principles, evaluation criteria for new opportunities, and coherence guidelines.

---

### 10. Brand Rules & Terminology Guide
**What it is:** A definitive guide to the language your brand uses and avoids:
- **Terms to Use** — The specific vocabulary that reinforces your positioning
- **Phrases to Avoid** — Language that undermines your brand or creates the wrong impression
- **Jargon Translations** — How to convert industry jargon into customer-friendly language
- **Tone Guidance by Context** — How your language shifts for different situations (formal vs. casual, educational vs. persuasive)

**Why it matters:** Brand voice consistency starts with vocabulary consistency. When one team member says "solutions" and another says "products" and a third says "offerings" — customers notice the inconsistency, even subconsciously.

**How it helps your business:** Hand this to every new hire, contractor, freelancer, or agency partner. Brand onboarding drops from weeks to hours. The "that doesn't sound like us" revision cycle disappears.

**What you'll see:** A language reference guide organized by context, with clear rules and examples.

---

### 11. Enhanced Buyer Personas — Psychographic Depth & Decision Triggers
**What it is:** Blueprint's buyer personas, expanded with deep psychographic profiling and decision trigger mapping:
- **Values & Beliefs** — What they stand for and what they won't compromise on
- **Fears & Anxieties** — What keeps them up at night (related to your category)
- **Aspirational Identity** — Who they want to become and how your brand helps them get there
- **Decision Triggers** — The specific moments, emotions, events, and circumstances that move them from browsing to buying (e.g., "lost a deal to a competitor," "got funding," "got negative feedback from a customer")

**Why it matters:** Demographics tell you who your customers are. Psychographics tell you why they buy. Decision triggers tell you when they buy. Blueprint+ gives you all three — the complete picture of what drives a purchase decision.

**How it helps your business:** Create marketing that doesn't just reach the right person — it reaches them at the right moment with the right message about the right fear or aspiration. This is the difference between marketing that interrupts and marketing that resonates.

**What you'll see:** Enhanced persona profiles with psychographic depth and a decision trigger map for each persona.

---

### 12. Customer Journey — Touchpoint-Specific Messaging & CTAs
**What it is:** Blueprint's customer journey map, enhanced with specific messaging scripts and CTAs for every touchpoint at every stage — not just strategic guidance, but the actual words to use at each interaction point.

**Why it matters:** Generic journey maps tell you what stage someone is in. Blueprint+ tells you what email subject line to send, what CTA to show, what objection to address, and what proof point to highlight — at that exact moment.

**How it helps your business:** Every touchpoint converts better because every touchpoint is scripted for that specific moment. Your welcome email, your retargeting ad, your checkout page, your follow-up sequence — each one has specific, pre-written messaging guidance.

**What you'll see:** An enhanced journey map with messaging scripts, CTA copy, and proof point recommendations for each touchpoint.

---

### 13. Audience Segments — How to Reach Different Groups
**What it is:** Segmented messaging strategies for each of your core audience groups — with specific guidance on what to say, where to say it, how to differentiate your approach, and how messaging evolves as each segment moves through your funnel.

**Why it matters:** "One-size-fits-all" messaging is the reason most marketing underperforms. Your enterprise segment needs different messaging than your SMB segment. Your awareness-stage audience needs different messaging than your decision-stage audience. This segmentation ensures every audience feels like you're speaking directly to them.

**How it helps your business:** Higher engagement, higher conversion, lower cost per acquisition — because every touchpoint feels personal to that specific audience.

**What you'll see:** Segment-specific messaging strategies with channel recommendations and funnel-stage adaptations.

---

### 14. Message Map — What to Say, to Whom, on Which Channel
**What it is:** A multi-dimensional messaging matrix that tells you exactly what to say to each audience segment, at each stage of the buyer's journey, on each marketing channel. Think of it as a 3D reference guide: Audience × Funnel Stage × Channel = exact message.

**Why it matters:** Your message to a cold prospect on LinkedIn is fundamentally different from your message to a warm lead in an email — even though both should sound like your brand. Without a message map, teams guess at these translations. With one, every communication is precise.

**How it helps your business:** Right message. Right audience. Right time. Right channel. That's the formula for conversion — and this gives it to you in a single reference document. Hand it to any team member or agency and they'll know exactly what to communicate in any context.

**What you'll see:** A structured messaging matrix you can reference for any audience/stage/channel combination.

---

### 15. Tagline & Slogan Recommendations — Audience & Channel Variations
**What it is:** The three tagline options from Blueprint, plus audience-specific and channel-specific variations — so your tagline flexes for LinkedIn vs. Instagram, B2B vs. B2C, awareness vs. conversion contexts.

**Why it matters:** One tagline doesn't fit every context. "Think Different" works on a billboard but not in a sales email. Variations let you stay on-brand while adapting to the platform, the audience, and the moment.

**How it helps your business:** Maximum flexibility with minimum brand drift. Every context gets a tagline calibrated to work in that specific environment.

**What you'll see:** Three core taglines with 2–3 variations each, organized by audience and channel.

---

### 16. Brand Story — Website, Pitch Deck & Social Versions
**What it is:** Your complete brand story in three distinct formats:
- **Website Version** — A strong About page draft with emotional hooks and strategic messaging woven throughout (review and personalize before publishing)
- **Pitch Deck Version** — Investor/partner-friendly, concise, outcome-focused
- **Social Media Version** — Bio-length, punchy, personality-forward

**Why it matters:** Different contexts need different lengths and tones. Your About page can be 500 words; your LinkedIn bio needs to be 150 characters. Rewriting your story for every context is time-consuming and introduces inconsistency.

**How it helps your business:** One story, three formats, zero rewriting. Copy and paste directly into your website, pitch deck, and social profiles.

**What you'll see:** Three formatted versions of your brand story, ready for immediate use.

---

### 17. Campaign Strategy & Narrative Arcs
**What it is:** Long-term campaign themes and narrative arcs — multi-quarter storytelling strategies that build brand equity over time:
- **Quarterly Themes** — 4 themes that build on each other throughout the year
- **Narrative Arc Structure** — How your brand story evolves across campaigns
- **Campaign Concepts** — Specific campaign ideas tied to each theme
- **Content Integration** — How campaigns connect to your content pillars and messaging system

**Why it matters:** Individual campaigns are tactics. A campaign strategy is a system. Most businesses reinvent their marketing every month — each campaign disconnected from the last. Narrative arcs create a throughline that deepens audience engagement over time.

**How it helps your business:** Stop starting from scratch every quarter. Build a narrative that compounds — each campaign building on the last, creating loyal followers instead of one-time buyers.

**What you'll see:** A four-quarter campaign framework with themes, concepts, and integration guidance.

---

### 18. Competitive Analysis — Strategic Moves & Counter-Positioning
**What it is:** An enhanced competitive analysis with:
- **Strategic Moves** — Specific actions to exploit identified competitive gaps
- **Counter-Positioning Strategies** — How to respond when competitors make moves in your space
- **Sequencing Guidance** — A recommended order for strategic moves, based on priority and dependencies
- **Opportunity Playbook** — A prioritized list of competitive opportunities with execution guidance

**Why it matters:** Knowing your competitors' potential weaknesses is step one. Having a playbook with timing and execution guidance is the advantage that separates reactive businesses from proactive ones.

**How it helps your business:** Move from defense to offense. Turn competitive intelligence into market opportunities — with a clear sense of what to do and when.

**What you'll see:** A competitive strategy document with prioritized opportunities, counter-positioning plays, and timing guidance.

> *Note: Competitive analysis is AI-informed. Strategic recommendations are based on available market intelligence and should be validated against your direct observations of competitor behavior.*

---

### 19. SEO Strategy — 15+ Keywords & Topic Clusters
**What it is:** An expanded SEO strategy with:
- **15+ Keyword Recommendations** — Organized into topic clusters that build topical authority
- **Topic Cluster Architecture** — How keywords group into themes that signal expertise to search engines
- **Content Pillar-to-Keyword Mapping** — Direct connections between your content strategy and search strategy
- **Authority Building Plan** — How to become the definitive source in your niche

**Why it matters:** Individual keywords are tactics. Topic clusters are strategy. Search engines increasingly reward topical authority — sites that comprehensively cover a subject — over individual keyword targeting. This strategy builds the content architecture for long-term search dominance.

**How it helps your business:** Dominate your niche in search results. Own topics, not just keywords. This approach compounds over time: each piece of content strengthens the authority of every other piece in the cluster.

**What you'll see:** A topic cluster strategy with 15+ keywords, cluster architecture, and an authority building plan.

> *Note: Keywords are AI-recommended strategic starting points. Validate with SEO tools for search volume and competition data before investing in content production.*

---

### 20. AEO Strategy — Full Implementation Roadmap
**What it is:** A phased implementation roadmap for Answer Engine Optimization:
- **Phase 1 (Months 1–3)** — Foundation: Entity establishment, core content structure, schema basics
- **Phase 2 (Months 4–6)** — Growth: Content expansion, authority building, citation optimization
- **Phase 3 (Months 7–12)** — Authority: Thought leadership positioning, expert content, advanced schema
- **Quarterly Milestones** — Specific checkpoints to measure progress
- **Measurement Framework** — How to track AI citation growth over time

**Why it matters:** AEO isn't a one-time fix. It's a 12-month strategy. Most businesses hear "optimize for AI search" and make a few changes to their About page. This roadmap gives you the systematic approach that actually builds AI authority.

**How it helps your business:** By month 12, your brand is the one AI tools recommend when your customers ask questions in your space. This roadmap gives you the systematic approach and clear milestones to work toward that outcome.

**What you'll see:** A 12-month phased roadmap with quarterly milestones and a measurement framework.

---

### 21. Email Marketing — Welcome + Nurture + Re-engagement
**What it is:** A complete email ecosystem:
- **Welcome Sequence** (4–5 emails) — From first opt-in to first conversion
- **Nurture Campaign** (3–5 emails) — For subscribers who aren't ready to buy yet
- **Re-engagement Sequence** — For dormant subscribers (the ones who stopped opening)
- **Automation Triggers** — What actions should trigger which emails
- **Advanced Segmentation** — How to split your list for maximum relevance

**Why it matters:** Your email list is your most valuable marketing asset — it's the only channel you own. But most lists underperform because they only have a welcome sequence (if that). The nurture campaign converts warm leads. The re-engagement sequence recovers lost subscribers. Together, they cover the full subscriber lifecycle.

**How it helps your business:** Turn cold subscribers into warm leads, warm leads into customers, and dormant contacts into re-engaged prospects. Email, done strategically, remains the highest-ROI channel in marketing.

**What you'll see:** A complete email strategy with individual email outlines, timing, triggers, and segmentation guidance.

---

### 22. Social Media Strategy — All Platforms + Repurposing Playbook
**What it is:** Expanded platform strategies covering all relevant platforms for your brand (not just 2–3), with a cross-platform content repurposing guide:
- **Per-Platform Strategy** — Content approach, format, posting cadence, and audience behavior for each platform
- **Repurposing Playbook** — How to turn one piece of content into platform-native versions for every channel (e.g., blog post → LinkedIn article → Twitter thread → Instagram carousel → Email newsletter)
- **Platform-to-Audience Mapping** — Which platforms serve which audience segments

**Why it matters:** Platform-native content performs 3–5x better than cross-posted content. But creating unique content for every platform is unsustainable. The repurposing playbook gives you the system to be native everywhere without creating everything from scratch.

**How it helps your business:** Maximum reach with minimum production effort. Produce 5x more content in the same amount of time — all on-brand, all platform-native.

**What you'll see:** Comprehensive platform strategies with a repurposing framework and platform-audience mapping.

---

### 23. Content Calendar
**What it is:** A structured content calendar with:
- **Monthly Themes** — Tied to your campaign strategy narrative arcs
- **Weekly Content Structure** — Which days, which platforms, which content types
- **Batching Strategy** — How to produce a week's content in one focused session
- **Repurposing Workflow** — A step-by-step process for turning one piece into five

**Why it matters:** Content consistency is the #1 challenge for small businesses. A pre-built calendar removes the daily decision fatigue of "what should we post?" It replaces inspiration-dependent content creation with system-driven content production.

**How it helps your business:** Open the calendar on Monday morning, see what's scheduled, create it, post it. No brainstorming. No blank page anxiety. The system produces consistent, strategic content week after week.

**What you'll see:** A monthly calendar template with themes, daily slots, format assignments, and batching guidance.

---

### 24. Conversion Strategy — Funnel-Specific CTAs with Ready-to-Use Copy
**What it is:** Blueprint's CTA hierarchy expanded with specific, pre-written CTAs for each funnel stage:
- **Awareness Stage CTAs** — Copy designed to capture initial interest (e.g., "Download the free guide," "See how top brands do it")
- **Consideration Stage CTAs** — Copy designed to deepen engagement (e.g., "Compare your options," "See how it works for [your industry]")
- **Decision Stage CTAs** — Copy designed to close (e.g., "Start your free trial," "Schedule a strategy call")
- **Each CTA includes:** The headline, the supporting copy, the button text, and placement guidance

**Why it matters:** Generic CTAs underperform because they ask for the same action regardless of where someone is in their journey. A cold visitor seeing "Book a Demo" bounces. That same visitor seeing "See how it works (2 min)" sticks around. Funnel-specific CTAs meet people where they are.

**How it helps your business:** Higher conversion rates at every stage of your funnel — with zero copywriting required on your part. Copy, paste, and test.

**What you'll see:** Pre-written CTAs for each funnel stage with headlines, copy, button text, and placement recommendations.

---

### 25. Company Descriptions — 6 Versions (Including Industry & Recruiting)
**What it is:** Six ready-to-use company descriptions:
- **One-Liner** (7–12 words) — Bios, email signatures, headers
- **Short Description** (2–3 sentences) — Directories, event programs, partnership pages
- **Full Boilerplate** (paragraph) — Press releases, media kits, formal communications
- **Proposal Introduction** — Pitches, RFPs, partnership proposals
- **Industry-Specific Description** — Tailored for your industry context, emphasizing sector-relevant credibility
- **Recruiting Description** — Written to attract talent, emphasizing culture, mission, and opportunity

**Why it matters:** Most businesses have one company description that they awkwardly edit for every context. Six purpose-built versions mean you always have the right description for the right situation.

**How it helps your business:** Responding to an RFP? Use the proposal version. Posting a job listing? Use the recruiting version. Talking to press? Use the boilerplate. Every professional context is covered. Zero writer's block.

**What you'll see:** Six descriptions, fully written and formatted for immediate use.

---

### 26. Strategic Action Plan — 5 Actions with Templates & Step-by-Step Guides
**What it is:** Every action from Blueprint's 5-action plan, expanded with:
- **Implementation Guide** — Numbered steps with time estimates
- **Ready-to-Use Templates** — Fill-in-the-blank tools (headline formulas, audit checklists, email frameworks, testimonial placement guides)
- **Concrete Examples** — What "done" looks like, across multiple channels
- **Quick-Win Tips** — How to get partial results in the first week
- **Priority Sequencing** — What to do first, what can wait, and why

**Why it matters:** Templates alone save 20+ hours of content creation and strategy work. The implementation guides eliminate the gap between "I know what to do" and "I know how to do it."

**How it helps your business:** Cut your implementation timeline in half. Instead of staring at a recommendation and wondering where to start, you'll have a numbered checklist, a template to fill in, and an example to reference.

**What you'll see:** Five expanded action plans with guides, templates, examples, and sequencing.

---

### 27. 90-Day Action Plan — Week-by-Week Deliverables & Milestones
**What it is:** A granular 90-day execution plan broken into weekly deliverables:
- **Week 1–4 (Foundation)** — What to complete, what to deliver, what "done" looks like
- **Week 5–8 (Build)** — Expanding on the foundation with content, campaigns, and systems
- **Week 9–12 (Optimize)** — Measuring results, adjusting strategy, building on wins
- **Weekly Milestones** — Specific completion criteria for each week
- **Accountability Checkpoints** — Built-in review moments to assess progress

**Why it matters:** "Do this in the first 30 days" is vague. "Complete these three tasks by Friday of week 2" is actionable. Weekly granularity creates the urgency and specificity that turns strategy into results.

**How it helps your business:** Open this on Monday morning and know exactly what to deliver this week. No ambiguity about what "making progress" looks like. Build momentum from day one.

**What you'll see:** A 12-week plan with weekly deliverables, milestones, and accountability checkpoints.

---

### 28. Guardrails — Brand Consistency Checklist & Review Criteria
**What it is:** A systematic framework for protecting your brand:
- **Brand Consistency Checklist** — A checklist to run against any new content, campaign, or asset before publishing
- **Review Criteria** — Specific questions to ask when evaluating whether something is on-brand
- **What Never Changes** — Core elements that must remain consistent regardless of context
- **What Can Evolve** — Elements that can flex as your brand grows
- **Delegation Guidelines** — How to maintain quality when others create on your behalf

**Why it matters:** Every new team member, agency partner, contractor, and marketing channel is a potential source of brand drift. Guardrails prevent it with a systematic review process — not micromanagement, but clear standards.

**How it helps your business:** Grow confidently. Hire confidently. Delegate confidently. Your brand stays intact even when you're not in the room reviewing every piece of content.

**What you'll see:** A brand consistency system with checklists, review criteria, and delegation guidelines.

---

### 29. Complete Measurement & Improvement Guide — Dedicated Framework with Scorecard
**What it is:** A comprehensive measurement framework that goes beyond the in-section KPIs from Blueprint:
- **What to Measure** — The specific metrics that matter for each domain (brand, content, conversion, channels)
- **What the Signals Mean** — How to interpret changes in your metrics
- **How to Adapt** — Decision trees for common scenarios ("If email open rates drop below X, do Y")
- **Quarterly Review Process** — A structured process for strategic review and adjustment
- **Integrated Scorecard** — A single tracking tool that brings all metrics into one view
- **NPS Implementation Guide** — A step-by-step guide to setting up a formal Net Promoter Score program, including the standard survey question, recommended tools, ideal send frequency, how to calculate and interpret your score, industry benchmarks, and how to act on the results. NPS is the gold standard for measuring customer loyalty and recommendation likelihood — and it requires a proper sample size (25+ responses minimum, 100+ for statistical validity) to be meaningful. This guide gives you everything you need to implement it as an ongoing practice.

**Why it matters:** The best strategy in the world fails without measurement. This guide ensures you're tracking the right things, interpreting them correctly, and adjusting based on data — not gut feel. The NPS guide specifically gives you a proven, industry-standard metric for tracking how your brand improvements translate into customer loyalty over time.

**How it helps your business:** Make data-driven decisions at every level. Know what's working, know what's not, and have a clear protocol for what to do about it. This is the system that turns brand strategy from a project into a practice. The NPS program becomes your ongoing pulse check — run it quarterly and watch how your brand strategy investments translate into real customer sentiment.

**What you'll see:** A measurement framework with metrics, interpretation guides, decision trees, an integrated scorecard template, and a complete NPS implementation guide with templates, tools, and benchmarks.

### 30. Advanced AI Prompt Pack (12 Prompts — 28 Total)
**What it is:** Twelve advanced AI prompts focused on scaling, optimization, and sophisticated strategic tasks:
- **Competitive Analysis Prompts** — Generate competitive intelligence and positioning arguments
- **Market Expansion Prompts** — Explore new audience segments, geographies, or product opportunities
- **Thought Leadership Prompts** — Create authoritative, opinion-driven content that builds industry credibility
- **Advanced Email Prompts** — Nurture campaigns, re-engagement sequences, segmented messaging
- **Campaign Development Prompts** — Multi-channel campaign concepts tied to your narrative arcs

Combined with the 8 Foundational (Snapshot+) and 8 Execution (Blueprint) prompts, you have **28 total brand-calibrated AI prompts** — a complete creative and strategic toolkit.

**Why it matters:** As your brand matures, your AI needs evolve. You're past "write me a blog post" — you need "analyze my competitive positioning and draft a differentiation argument for enterprise buyers." These prompts handle the complex, strategic work.

**How it helps your business:** 28 prompts that cover every stage of brand management: strategy, creation, distribution, analysis, and optimization. Each one is pre-loaded with your specific brand context, so the output is immediately usable.

**What you'll see:** 12 advanced prompts organized by strategic function, each with the full prompt text, strategic context, and usage guidance.

### 31. Complimentary 30-Minute Strategy Activation Session
**What it is:** A live, one-on-one, 30-minute strategy session with a brand strategist from Wunderbar Digital. During the session, we'll:
- **Review your diagnostic results** together — ensuring you understand every section and its implications
- **Prioritize your highest-impact next moves** — helping you decide what to tackle first based on your resources and timeline
- **Answer your specific questions** — about your brand, your market, or how to implement any section of the report
- **Create a focused action plan** — so you walk away with clarity and confidence about your next 30 days

**Why it matters:** AI builds the strategy. A human reviews it with you. There are nuances that only a conversation can surface — questions about your specific market, concerns about implementation, or strategic pivots that the AI can't anticipate. The activation session bridges the gap between "I have a document" and "I have a plan."

**How it helps your business:** The session alone is worth $500+ at standard consulting rates. It ensures you're not just holding a great strategy document — you're ready to execute on it with confidence. And if you need more support after the session, our team is available for ongoing engagement.

**What you'll see:** A scheduling link included with your report. Sessions are typically held within 2 weeks of report delivery.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long does the assessment take?**
About 10–15 minutes. Results are delivered instantly.

**Do I need to buy the lower tiers first?**
No — Blueprint+ includes everything from all lower tiers. It's a single purchase that gives you the complete system.

**What if I already bought Snapshot+ or Blueprint?**
Every dollar you've already spent is credited toward your Blueprint+ upgrade. You'll never pay twice for the same tier.

**When is the strategy session scheduled?**
After your report is delivered, you'll receive a scheduling link. Sessions are typically held within 2 weeks.

**Can I share the report with my team?**
Absolutely. The report is designed to be a shared reference document. Share the PDF, use the templates in team meetings, and reference the messaging system in content briefs.

**Is the VOC survey required?**
No — it's optional but highly recommended. It's the only way to incorporate real customer feedback into your report. You can send it before or after receiving your results, and the analysis integrates as responses come in. Minimum 3 responses for meaningful analysis.

**Can I retake the assessment to track progress over time?**
Yes — and with Blueprint+, quarterly refreshes are unlimited and free. Retake the assessment every quarter, and your dashboard shows a live score trend chart comparing your WunderBrand Score™ and all five pillar scores over time. Other tiers pay $47–$97 per refresh; this is included with your purchase.

**What if I need ongoing support beyond the session?**
Our team offers managed marketing services and AI consulting engagements. We'll discuss options during your strategy session if you're interested.
