## What You'll Get

### 1. Brand Alignment Score™ (0–100)
**What it is:** A single, proprietary score that measures how well your brand's five strategic pillars work together — from positioning to conversion.

**How it helps your business:** Instead of guessing what's working, you get an objective baseline. Know instantly whether your brand is creating clarity or confusion for your customers.

**The benefit:** Make confident decisions about where to invest your time and budget. No more "spray and pray" marketing.

---

### 2. Five-Pillar Brand Analysis
**What it is:** A scored breakdown across the five pillars that drive brand performance — Positioning, Messaging, Visibility, Credibility, and Conversion — each rated on a 20-point scale.

**How it helps your business:** See exactly which parts of your brand are pulling their weight and which are holding you back. Every score comes with three insights: What's Working, What's Unclear, and Why This Matters.

**The benefit:** Stop treating all brand problems the same. Focus on the specific pillar that will unlock the most growth for the least effort.

---

### 3. Primary Focus Area Identification
**What it is:** We identify your single highest-impact opportunity — the one pillar where focused improvement will create the biggest ripple effect across your entire brand.

**How it helps your business:** When everything feels like a priority, nothing is. This tells you exactly where to start.

**The benefit:** Move from overwhelm to action in one step. You'll know what to fix first and why it matters most.

---

### 4. Brand Archetype Analysis
**What it is:** Discover which of the 12 brand archetypes (e.g., The Explorer, The Sage, The Creator) best represents your brand's personality — including when it works, and how it can backfire.

**How it helps your business:** Your archetype shapes everything: your tone of voice, visual identity, content strategy, and how customers emotionally connect with you.

**The benefit:** Build a consistent brand personality that resonates with your ideal customers — and stop sounding like a different company on every channel.

---

### 5. Personalized Next Steps
**What it is:** Three specific, prioritized actions tailored to your results — not generic advice.

**How it helps your business:** Each recommendation is tied to a specific pillar and outcome, so you know exactly what to do and what will change when you do it.

**The benefit:** Walk away with a clear starting point, not a vague to-do list.

---

### 6. Wundy™ AI Brand Guide
**What it is:** Your AI-powered brand advisor — available right in the app to answer questions about branding concepts, archetypes, the five pillars, and how to interpret your results.

**How it helps your business:** Get instant answers without Googling. Ask Wundy what "positioning" means, how archetypes work, or what your score range indicates.

**The benefit:** Learn while you build. Every interaction makes you a smarter brand owner.

---

### 7. PDF Download
**What it is:** A print-ready, professionally formatted PDF of your complete Brand Snapshot results.

**How it helps your business:** Share with your team, partners, or marketing agency. Reference it during strategy meetings or planning sessions.
