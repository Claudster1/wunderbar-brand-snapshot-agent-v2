# WunderBrand Snapshot™ — Product Page Content (Free)

> Headline: Know Where Your Brand Stands — In Minutes, Not Months
> Subhead: Most businesses operate with a blind spot about their own brand. In about 15–20 minutes, you'll get an objective, data-driven diagnostic that shows you exactly what's working, what's not, and where to focus first. No credit card. No sales call. Just clarity.

---

## Why This Exists

Traditional brand audits cost $2,000–$5,000 and take 2–4 weeks. Most small business owners never get one — so they guess. They guess which marketing channel to prioritize. They guess why leads aren't converting. They guess whether their messaging is landing.

WunderBrand Snapshot™ eliminates the guessing. In about 15–20 minutes, you'll answer a set of strategic questions about your business, and our AI engine will analyze your responses to produce a scored diagnostic that would take a human strategist hours to deliver.

It's free because we believe every business deserves to know where they stand.

## What You'll Get

### 1. WunderBrand Score™ (0–100)
**What it is:** A single, proprietary score that measures how well your brand's five strategic pillars — Positioning, Messaging, Visibility, Credibility, and Conversion — work together as a system. Your score is calculated from your diagnostic answers using a deterministic scoring engine, not an arbitrary opinion.

**Why it matters:** You can't improve what you can't measure. Most businesses have never quantified their brand's health. This score gives you a baseline — a number you can track over time as you make improvements. It also lets you immediately see whether your brand is creating clarity or confusion for your customers.

**How it helps your business:** Instead of pouring money into marketing and hoping it works, you'll have an objective starting point. If your score is 45, you know there's significant friction in your brand system. If it's 78, you know your foundation is solid and can focus on optimization. Either way, you're making decisions from data, not gut feel.

**What you'll see:** A visual gauge with your score, a plain-language interpretation (e.g., "Strong Foundation — Room to Optimize"), and how your overall brand system performs.

---

### 2. Five-Pillar Brand Analysis
**What it is:** Your WunderBrand Score™ is broken into five individual pillar scores — each rated on a 20-point scale:
- **Positioning** — How clearly you've defined what you do, who you serve, and why you're different
- **Messaging** — Whether your words are landing with the right people in the right way
- **Visibility** — How easy it is for the right customers to find and recognize your brand
- **Credibility** — Whether prospects trust you enough to take the next step
- **Conversion** — How effectively your brand turns interest into action

For each pillar, you'll receive three specific insights: **What's Working** (your strengths), **What's Unclear** (where confusion lives), and **Why This Matters** (the business impact).

**Why it matters:** Your brand doesn't succeed or fail as a monolith — it succeeds or fails pillar by pillar. You might have strong positioning but weak visibility, which means you have a great story that nobody hears. Or strong credibility but weak conversion, which means people trust you but can't figure out how to buy. The five-pillar breakdown shows you where the system is breaking down.

**How it helps your business:** Stop treating all brand problems the same. You'll know whether to invest in better messaging, more visibility, stronger proof, or a clearer conversion path. This alone can save thousands in misdirected marketing spend.

**What you'll see:** Five scored pillar cards, each with a numeric score, a performance indicator, and three insight blocks.

---

### 3. Where to Focus First
**What it is:** Based on your pillar scores and the relationships between them, we identify your single highest-impact opportunity — the one area where focused improvement will create the biggest ripple effect across your entire brand.

**Why it matters:** When everything feels like a priority, nothing is. Most business owners try to fix everything at once and end up fixing nothing. Your primary focus area is the strategic domino — the one that, when addressed, improves multiple pillars simultaneously.

**How it helps your business:** You'll walk away knowing exactly where to start. Not "here are 20 things you could do" — but "this is the ONE thing that will move the needle most." That clarity alone is worth hours of consulting.

**What you'll see:** Your primary focus area highlighted with a clear explanation of why it was chosen and what addressing it will unlock.

---

### 4. Your Brand's Core Personality Type (Archetype)
**What it is:** Using the signals from your diagnostic — how you make decisions, where your authority comes from, your approach to risk, and what your customers expect — we map your brand to one of 12 established brand archetypes (e.g., The Sage, The Explorer, The Creator, The Ruler). You'll see which archetype best represents your brand's natural personality, including when it works, how it can backfire, and what it means for your tone of voice.

**Why it matters:** Your brand archetype isn't a gimmick — it's the psychological foundation that determines how customers emotionally connect with you. Apple (The Creator), Nike (The Hero), and Patagonia (The Explorer) didn't build billion-dollar brands by accident. They built them on consistent archetypal identities.

**How it helps your business:** Once you know your archetype, every brand decision becomes easier. Should your website feel bold or warm? Should your emails be inspirational or authoritative? Should your social media be playful or serious? Your archetype answers these questions. It also helps you stop sounding like a different company on every channel — a problem that quietly erodes customer trust.

**What you'll see:** Your primary archetype with a description, strengths, risks, and tone of voice guidance.

---

### 5. Personalized Recommendations
**What it is:** Three specific, prioritized actions tailored to your diagnostic results — not generic advice. Each recommendation is tied to a specific pillar and a specific outcome, with enough detail to understand what to do and why it matters.

**Why it matters:** Diagnosis without a prescription is frustrating. You don't just want to know your brand has a problem — you want to know what to do about it. These recommendations bridge the gap between "here's what we found" and "here's your first three moves."

**How it helps your business:** You'll leave with a clear, actionable starting point. Whether it's tightening your homepage headline, adding testimonials to your sales process, or clarifying your differentiator — you'll know what to do this week, not someday.

**What you'll see:** Three ranked recommendations with the target pillar, the expected outcome, and a plain-language description of the action.

---

### 6. What Your Scores Mean (Plain-Language Interpretation)
**What it is:** A clear, jargon-free explanation of your overall score and each pillar score — what the numbers actually mean for your business right now.

**Why it matters:** A score of 62 is meaningless without context. Is that good? Bad? Average? This section translates your numbers into business language: what's performing, what's costing you, and how urgent the gaps are.

**How it helps your business:** You'll understand your results without needing a marketing degree. Share this with a co-founder, a freelancer, or an agency and they'll immediately understand where your brand stands.

**What you'll see:** A written interpretation for your overall score and each pillar, with performance ratings and explanations.

---

### 7. Downloadable PDF Report (Print-Ready)
**What it is:** A professionally designed, print-ready PDF of your complete WunderBrand Snapshot™ results — including your score, pillar breakdown, archetype, recommendations, and all insights.

**Why it matters:** Digital reports get lost in browser tabs. A PDF lives in your files — you can print it, attach it to an email, bring it to a meeting, or share it with a partner or advisor.

**How it helps your business:** Use it as a reference document during strategic planning. Share it with your marketing team or agency so everyone starts from the same baseline. Keep it to compare against future diagnostics and track your progress.

**What you'll see:** A branded, multi-page PDF with all your results formatted for easy reading and sharing.

---

### 8. Wundy™ AI Brand Guide
**What it is:** Your AI-powered brand advisor, built into the app. Wundy™ can answer questions about branding concepts ("What does positioning mean?"), explain the five pillars, help you understand your archetype, and provide general brand guidance.

**Why it matters:** Not everyone has a marketing background. Wundy™ bridges the knowledge gap so you can understand your results and make smarter decisions — without hiring a consultant or spending hours on Google.

**How it helps your business:** Ask Wundy™ "Why does my Credibility score matter?" or "How do I improve my Conversion pillar?" and get an instant, plain-language answer. It's like having a brand advisor on call — one who never charges by the hour.

**What you'll see:** A chat interface available directly in your report. Ask questions, get answers, learn as you go.
