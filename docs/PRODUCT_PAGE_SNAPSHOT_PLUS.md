## Everything in Brand Snapshot™, Plus:

---

### 1. Priority Diagnosis — Primary & Secondary Focus Areas
**What it is:** An in-depth diagnosis of your two highest-impact opportunities. For each, you'll see exactly why it matters, what downstream issues it's causing, and what improves when you address it.

**How it helps your business:** Your brand doesn't have one problem — it has a system of connected issues. This shows you the root causes, not just the symptoms.

**The benefit:** Fix two things and watch five things improve. That's the power of knowing where to aim.

---

### 2. Pillar Deep Dives with Commercial Impact
**What it is:** For each of your five pillars, you'll receive an expanded analysis covering: What's Happening Now, Why It Matters Commercially, Industry Context, Financial Impact, Risk of Inaction, a Before/After Concrete Example, and a Strategic Recommendation.

**How it helps your business:** Stop guessing whether a brand problem is costing you money. Every pillar analysis connects to real business outcomes — lost leads, lower conversion rates, weaker pricing power.

**The benefit:** Build the business case for brand investment with language your leadership team, investors, or partners can understand.

---

### 3. Industry Benchmarking
**What it is:** See how your Brand Alignment Score compares to anonymized scores from businesses in your industry and size range.

**How it helps your business:** A score of 62 means one thing if your competitors average 45, and something very different if they average 78.

**The benefit:** Know if you're leading your market or falling behind — and by how much.

---

### 4. Dual Brand Archetype System
**What it is:** Your primary and secondary archetypes, fully analyzed — including alignment strategies, misuse risks, tone guidance, and how the two archetypes work together.

**How it helps your business:** Most brands aren't one-dimensional. Your primary archetype drives your core identity, while your secondary adds nuance and depth.

**The benefit:** Create messaging that feels rich and authentic instead of flat and formulaic.

---

### 5. Brand Persona & Communication Style
**What it is:** A complete persona profile including: Core Identity (who you are, what you stand for, how you show up), Communication Style (tone, pace, energy), Messaging Examples (headlines, CTAs, social posts), and Communication Guidelines (Do's and Don'ts with concrete examples).

**How it helps your business:** Hand this to any copywriter, designer, or AI tool and they'll produce on-brand content without a 30-minute briefing.

**The benefit:** Consistency at scale. Every piece of content sounds like it came from the same brand — because it did.

---

### 6. Audience Signals & Ideal Customer Profile
**What it is:** A data-informed breakdown of your audience: who they are, what language they use, what drives their decisions, what holds them back, and where to reach them — including an Ideal Customer Profile with demographics, psychographics, and behavioral patterns.

**How it helps your business:** Stop marketing to "everyone." Start speaking directly to the people most likely to buy.

**The benefit:** Lower cost per acquisition. Higher conversion rates. Marketing that actually resonates.

---

### 7. Messaging Pillars
**What it is:** Three core messaging pillars, each with: what it communicates, why it matters to your audience, and an example message you can use immediately.

**How it helps your business:** Every piece of content you create should trace back to one of these pillars. They keep your messaging focused and consistent across every channel.

**The benefit:** Never stare at a blank page again. Your messaging pillars are the strategic backbone of your content.

---

### 8. Visual & Verbal Brand Signals
**What it is:** A recommended color palette with hex codes and usage guidance, color direction rationale, colors to avoid, voice trait analysis, and consistency risk warnings.

**How it helps your business:** Your visual identity isn't decoration — it's brand communication. Every color choice signals something about your business.

**The benefit:** Show up visually with the same intentionality as your messaging. No more random color choices or inconsistent brand aesthetics.

---

### 9. Visibility & Discovery Analysis with AEO Readiness
**What it is:** A complete visibility diagnostic: how people should find you, how they actually find you, the gap between the two, plus an AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) readiness score with recommendations for being cited by AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews.

**How it helps your business:** If AI can't find and recommend you, you're invisible to a growing segment of your market. This tells you exactly where you stand and what to do about it.

**The benefit:** Future-proof your discoverability. Be the brand that AI recommends — not the one it overlooks.

---

### 10. Strategic Action Plan
**What it is:** Five prioritized actions, each with: the outcome it drives, the pillar it strengthens, why it matters, how to implement it (step-by-step), a concrete example, and effort/impact ratings.

**How it helps your business:** This isn't a list of suggestions. It's a prioritized execution plan with enough detail to act on this week.

**The benefit:** Go from "I know what's wrong" to "I know exactly what to do" — in priority order.

---

### 11. 90-Day Phased Roadmap
**What it is:** A structured 30/60/90-day execution plan that sequences your strategic actions for maximum momentum.

**How it helps your business:** Knowing what to do isn't enough. You need to know what to do first, what to do next, and what to save for later.

**The benefit:** Build compounding momentum instead of jumping between disconnected tactics.

---

### 12. Tagline & Slogan Recommendations
**What it is:** Three professionally crafted tagline options, each with rationale, tone analysis, and placement guidance.

**How it helps your business:** A strong tagline crystallizes your positioning into a single memorable line. These are calibrated to your archetype, audience, and differentiators.

**The benefit:** Stop agonizing over your headline. Start with three expert-crafted options and refine from there.

---

### 13. Foundational AI Prompt Pack (8 Prompts)
**What it is:** Eight ready-to-use AI prompts calibrated to your specific business, brand voice, and strategic priorities. Each includes the prompt itself, the strategic category, and an explanation of why it matters.

**How it helps your business:** Copy, paste, and generate brand-aligned content instantly. These aren't generic prompts — they're trained on your diagnostic data.

**The benefit:** Turn AI from a generic tool into a brand-aware content partner. Every output sounds like your brand.

---

### 14. VOC Brand Perception Survey
**What it is:** A built-in tool to send a 2-minute survey to 5–10 of your customers, collecting their perception of your brand. Results are AI-analyzed and integrated into your diagnostic — including NPS, perception gaps, blind spots, and discovery channels.

**How it helps your business:** See the gap between how you think your brand is perceived and how your customers actually experience it. These gaps are where revenue hides.

**The benefit:** The most expensive brand mistakes are the ones you don't know you're making. This finds them for you.

---

### 15. Wundy™ Report Companion (Report-Aware AI)
**What it is:** A version of Wundy that has read your entire report and can answer specific questions like "Why did I score low on Credibility?" or "How should I apply my archetype to social media?"

**How it helps your business:** Like having a brand strategist on call — one who knows your results inside and out.

**The benefit:** Get personalized guidance without booking a consulting session. Available 24/7.

---

### 16. Report Navigation & Search
**What it is:** Built-in section navigation, search, and a sticky breadcrumb bar so you can jump to any section of your report instantly.

**How it helps your business:** Your report is extensive. Navigation tools make it a living reference document, not something you read once and forget.

**The benefit:** Find what you need in seconds, every time you come back to it.
