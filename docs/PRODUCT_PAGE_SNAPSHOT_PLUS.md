## Why Upgrade from the Free WunderBrand Snapshot™?

Your free WunderBrand Snapshot™ told you what's working and what's not. WunderBrand Snapshot+™ tells you **why it matters commercially, what it's costing you, and exactly what to do about it** — with a 90-day plan, messaging pillars, visual direction, and 8 AI prompts calibrated to your brand.

Think of it this way: the free Snapshot is your brand's blood pressure reading. Snapshot+ is the full diagnostic workup — with a treatment plan.

---

## Everything in WunderBrand Snapshot™, Plus:

---

### 1. Additional Focus Areas & Gaps in Your Brand's Story
**What it is:** Beyond your primary focus area, Snapshot+ identifies secondary and tertiary improvement opportunities — plus specific gaps in your brand narrative where your story breaks down, confuses, or goes silent. You'll see exactly where your brand's "plotline" has holes.

**Why it matters:** Your brand doesn't have one problem — it has a system of connected issues. The free Snapshot shows you the biggest one. Snapshot+ shows you the ones lurking beneath the surface — the issues that, if left unaddressed, will undermine the improvements you make elsewhere.

**How it helps your business:** Fix the obvious problem AND the hidden ones. For example, your Positioning might be clear, but if your Credibility pillar reveals that your proof is invisible, prospects will understand your value but won't trust you enough to act. Snapshot+ makes these connections explicit so you're not leaving money on the table.

**What you'll see:** A prioritized list of secondary focus areas, each with an explanation of why it matters and how it connects to your primary focus area.

---

### 2. Pillar Deep Dives with Commercial Impact
**What it is:** For each of your five pillars, you'll receive an expanded analysis that goes far beyond a score. Each deep dive covers:
- **What's Happening Now** — A specific, detailed assessment of your current state
- **Why It Matters Commercially** — How this pillar directly affects revenue, leads, conversion rates, and customer behavior
- **How Each Gap Affects Your Business** — How each weakness connects to real business outcomes like lead quality, conversion rates, and customer trust
- **What Happens If You Don't Act** — The risk of inaction: what gets worse over time if this pillar stays neglected
- **Before & After Example** — A concrete, side-by-side example showing what improvement looks like in practice (e.g., a weak homepage headline vs. a strong one)
- **Strategic Recommendation** — A specific action tied to a specific outcome

**Why it matters:** Most brand diagnostics stop at "your messaging needs work." That's not useful. You need to know that weak messaging typically leads to longer sales cycles, that unclear value propositions make it easier for competitors to win deals, and that unaddressed gaps tend to compound over time. Snapshot+ connects each gap to the business outcomes it most likely affects.

**How it helps your business:** Build the business case for brand investment — in language your co-founder, leadership team, or investors will understand. Stop defending "we need to work on our brand" with vague arguments. Start saying "our Credibility pillar score of 8/20 means prospects likely aren't seeing enough proof to take the next step — and here's what to do about it."

**What you'll see:** Five detailed pillar sections, each 3–5 paragraphs with specific, actionable analysis tailored to your business.

---

### 3. How Your Brand Pillars Work Together (Or Against Each Other)
**What it is:** An analysis of how your five pillars interact as a system — where they reinforce each other and where misalignment between pillars is undermining your overall performance.

**Why it matters:** Your pillars don't exist in isolation. Strong Messaging with weak Visibility means you have a great story nobody hears. Strong Credibility with weak Conversion means people trust you but can't figure out how to buy. This section reveals the dynamics between your pillars — the reinforcement loops and the friction points.

**How it helps your business:** When you understand how your pillars interact, you can sequence your improvements strategically. Fix the pillar that's blocking the others first, and the entire system improves. This is the difference between random marketing fixes and strategic brand building.

**What you'll see:** A system-level analysis showing which pillars are amplifying each other and which are creating friction, with guidance on what to prioritize.

---

### 4. AI-Informed Industry Context
**What it is:** Your scores placed in the context of your industry and business type — how your WunderBrand Score™ and pillar performance compare to what AI analysis suggests is typical for businesses in your space.

**Why it matters:** A Visibility score of 12 means something different for a local service business than for a national e-commerce brand. Industry context transforms raw numbers into strategic intelligence.

**How it helps your business:** Know whether your scores represent an opportunity to lead your market or a signal that you're falling behind. Context determines urgency — and urgency determines action.

**What you'll see:** Your scores framed within industry context, with guidance on whether each pillar represents a strength or a gap relative to your market.

---

### 5. Dual Brand Archetype System (Primary & Supporting)
**What it is:** Your primary archetype (from the free Snapshot) plus a supporting secondary archetype — fully analyzed with alignment strategies, misuse risks, tone guidance, and how the two archetypes create depth and nuance together.

**Why it matters:** Real brands aren't one-dimensional. Patagonia isn't just The Explorer — there's Caregiver energy in their environmental mission. Nike isn't just The Hero — there's Creator energy in their innovation story. Your secondary archetype adds the texture that makes your brand feel human and complete, not like a marketing template.

**How it helps your business:** You'll know how to layer your communication. When to lead with authority (primary) and when to lean into warmth (secondary). When to be bold and when to be approachable. This dual system gives you range without sacrificing consistency.

**What you'll see:** Both archetypes with descriptions, alignment analysis, tone guidance, and practical "do this, not that" examples.

---

### 6. Brand Persona & Communication Style Guide
**What it is:** A complete persona profile that defines how your brand shows up in the world:
- **Core Identity** — Who you are, what you stand for, how you show up
- **Communication Style** — Tone, pace, energy, vocabulary level
- **Messaging Examples** — Actual sample headlines, CTAs, and social posts written in your brand voice
- **Communication Guidelines** — Specific Do's and Don'ts with concrete examples (e.g., "DO: Use direct, confident language like 'Here's what we know works.' DON'T: Use hedging language like 'We think maybe this could help.'")

**Why it matters:** Brand inconsistency is the silent killer of trust. When your website sounds professional, your social media sounds casual, and your emails sound robotic — customers notice, even if they can't articulate it. A communication style guide creates one voice across every channel.

**How it helps your business:** Hand this to any copywriter, designer, freelancer, or AI tool and they'll produce on-brand content without a 30-minute briefing. It's the difference between "write something for our brand" and "here's exactly how our brand sounds — follow this."

**What you'll see:** A multi-section style guide with practical examples and rules you can share with anyone who creates content for your brand.

---

### 7. Who's Paying Attention & Ideal Customer Profile
**What it is:** An AI-generated breakdown of your audience based on your diagnostic answers and industry patterns: who your current customers likely are, who your ideal customers could be, what language they tend to use, what drives their decisions, what holds them back, and where to reach them. Includes a full Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) with demographics, psychographics, behavioral patterns, and buying motivators.

**Why it matters:** "Everyone" is not a target audience. The most expensive marketing mistake is targeting broadly and hoping the right people notice. Your ICP defines who to pursue with precision — so every marketing dollar reaches someone likely to buy.

**How it helps your business:** Lower cost per acquisition. Higher conversion rates. Marketing that resonates instead of marketing that gets scrolled past. When you know exactly who you're talking to, every message hits harder.

**What you'll see:** A complete ICP with who they are, what they care about, where they spend time, what objections they have, and what language converts them.

---

### 8. Messaging Pillars (3 Core Pillars)
**What it is:** Three core messaging pillars — the strategic themes your brand should reinforce in every piece of content. Each pillar includes what it communicates, why it matters to your audience, and an example message you can use immediately.

**Why it matters:** Without messaging pillars, content creation is random. You post whatever feels right that day and hope it builds to something. With messaging pillars, every blog post, email, social update, and ad reinforces one of three strategic themes — building cumulative brand equity instead of random noise.

**How it helps your business:** Your messaging pillars are the backbone of your content strategy. They answer the question "What should we post about?" with "One of these three themes — always." That constraint is actually freedom: you'll create more and better content because you're not starting from a blank page.

**What you'll see:** Three named pillars, each with a description, audience relevance, and a ready-to-use example message.

---

### 9. Content Strategy Direction (Foundational)
**What it is:** A foundational content direction covering what types of content to create, where to publish them, and how your content connects to your messaging pillars and business goals.

**Why it matters:** Content without strategy is noise. Posting three times a week doesn't help if the posts don't build toward anything. This gives you the strategic layer that connects every piece of content to a business outcome.

**How it helps your business:** Instead of "we should really be posting more," you'll have "here's what to post, where to post it, and what it should accomplish." It's the starting framework that makes a full content strategy (available in Blueprint) possible.

**What you'll see:** Content direction tied to your messaging pillars, with channel recommendations and format suggestions.

---

### 10. Brand Color Palette with Exact Color Codes
**What it is:** A recommended color palette tailored to your brand's personality, archetype, and industry — with hex codes for each color, usage guidance (primary, secondary, accent), the psychology behind each choice, and colors to avoid.

**Why it matters:** Color isn't decoration — it's communication. Studies show that color increases brand recognition by up to 80%. The right palette instantly signals who you are: trustworthy (blue), energetic (orange), sophisticated (black and gold), or innovative (purple). The wrong palette creates dissonance between what you say and what people feel.

**How it helps your business:** A consistent color palette applied across your website, social media, pitch decks, and marketing materials creates visual coherence. Customers begin to recognize you before they read a word. It also eliminates the "what color should this be?" conversation on every design project.

**What you'll see:** 4–6 colors with hex codes, a usage hierarchy, psychology rationale, and a "colors to avoid" section.

---

### 11. Visibility & Discovery Strategy with AI Search Readiness
**What it is:** A complete assessment of your brand's discoverability: how people should be finding you, how they likely are finding you (based on your stated channels and approach), the gap between the two, plus an AI Search Readiness Framework — an analysis of how prepared your brand is to be cited by AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews.

**Why it matters:** Visibility is shifting. Traditional SEO still matters, but AI-powered search is rapidly changing how customers discover businesses. If your brand isn't structured to be found and recommended by AI tools, you're invisible to a growing segment of your market.

**How it helps your business:** You'll see exactly where your visibility gaps are — and whether they're in traditional channels, AI-powered channels, or both. This lets you prioritize the visibility investments that will have the biggest impact for your specific business and audience.

**What you'll see:** A visibility assessment with channel analysis, a readiness framework for AI-powered discovery, and prioritized recommendations.

> *Note: AI Search Readiness is a strategic assessment of your brand's readiness factors — not a live measurement of current AI citations. It evaluates the elements that influence AI discoverability (content structure, authority signals, entity clarity) and provides a roadmap for improvement.*

---

### 12. Tagline & Slogan Recommendations (3 Options)
**What it is:** Three AI-generated tagline options tailored to your brand, each with the tagline itself, the strategic rationale (why this works for your brand), tone analysis (how it aligns with your archetype), and placement guidance (where to use it).

**Why it matters:** A strong tagline crystallizes your entire positioning into a single memorable line. It's the phrase that lives in your customer's head when they think of you. Getting it right accelerates every other brand effort; getting it wrong (or having none) means you're relying on people to summarize you themselves — and they usually get it wrong.

**How it helps your business:** Stop agonizing over your headline, bio, or elevator pitch. Start with three expert-calibrated options and refine from there. Even if you don't use them verbatim, they'll sharpen your thinking about how to describe what you do.

**What you'll see:** Three tagline options, each with rationale, tone analysis, and suggested placement.

---

### 13. Strategic Action Plan (5 Prioritized Actions)
**What it is:** Five specific, prioritized actions — each with:
- **Which pillar it strengthens** and why that matters right now
- **The outcome it drives** — what changes when you complete this action
- **Why this action, in this order** — the strategic logic behind the prioritization
- **How to implement it** — step-by-step guidance with enough detail to start this week
- **A concrete example** — what "done" looks like in practice
- **Effort/impact rating** — so you can choose quick wins or high-impact projects based on your capacity

**Why it matters:** Most business owners finish a brand diagnostic and think "great, now what?" This is the "now what." Five actions, ranked by impact, with implementation guidance. Not 20 things you could do — five things you should do, in order.

**How it helps your business:** Move from diagnosis to action immediately. Each action is designed to create visible improvement in 30 days or less, building momentum and confidence for the bigger strategic work ahead.

**What you'll see:** A ranked action plan with implementation details, examples, and effort/impact ratings.

---

### 14. 90-Day Phased Roadmap with Guardrails
**What it is:** A structured 30/60/90-day execution plan that sequences your five strategic actions and additional improvements for maximum momentum. Includes guardrails — specific rules and checkpoints to keep you on track when daily business pressures pull you off strategy.

**Why it matters:** Knowing what to do isn't enough. You need to know what to do first, what to do next, and what to save for later. Without a roadmap, most businesses implement one or two things, get busy, and never finish. The 90-day structure creates urgency and accountability.

**How it helps your business:** Build compounding momentum instead of jumping between disconnected tactics. Each month builds on the previous one, so by day 90, you haven't just completed a checklist — you've built a stronger brand system.

**What you'll see:** A three-phase roadmap with specific actions per phase, plus guardrails to prevent scope creep and strategic drift.

---

### 15. Foundational AI Prompt Pack (8 Prompts)
**What it is:** Eight ready-to-use AI prompts (for ChatGPT, Claude, or any major AI tool) that are calibrated to your specific business, brand voice, archetype, and strategic priorities. Each prompt includes the prompt itself, the strategic category it serves, and a "Why It Matters" explanation so you understand the strategic logic behind it.

**Why it matters:** Generic AI prompts produce generic content. "Write a blog post about marketing" gives you something anyone could have written. But "Write a blog post for [your brand name], a [your archetype] brand in [your industry] targeting [your ICP], focusing on [your messaging pillar]" gives you content that sounds like you — because the prompt was built from your diagnostic data.

**How it helps your business:** Copy, paste, and generate brand-aligned content in minutes. Use the prompts for blog posts, email drafts, social media content, product descriptions, ad copy — anything that needs to sound like your brand. Each prompt saves 30–60 minutes of briefing and revision.

**What you'll see:** Eight prompts organized by strategic category (e.g., "Brand Voice Content," "Audience-Targeted Messaging," "Positioning Reinforcement"), each with the full prompt text and a strategic context explanation.

---

### 16. Wundy™ Report Companion (Report-Aware AI)
**What it is:** An upgraded version of Wundy™ that has read your entire Snapshot+ report and can answer specific questions about your results. Ask "Why did I score 9 on Credibility?" or "How should I apply my archetype to email marketing?" or "What's the connection between my Messaging and Conversion scores?" — and get a personalized, context-aware answer.

**Why it matters:** Your report contains hundreds of insights. Wundy™ helps you navigate them, ask follow-up questions, and get guidance tailored to your situation — like having a brand strategist who's already read your entire file.

**How it helps your business:** Save hours of re-reading and interpretation. Get instant answers to the questions that matter most to you, right when they come up. Available 24/7, no appointment needed.

**What you'll see:** A chat interface within your report that understands your results and can provide personalized guidance.

---

### 17. Report Navigation & Search
**What it is:** Built-in section navigation, search, and a sticky breadcrumb bar so you can jump to any section of your extensive report instantly.

**Why it matters:** Your Snapshot+ report is significantly more detailed than the free Snapshot. Navigation tools ensure you can find what you need in seconds — making the report a living reference document you'll return to repeatedly, not something you read once and file away.

**How it helps your business:** Quick access means you'll actually use the report. Pull up your messaging pillars before a copywriting session. Reference your ICP before creating an ad. Check your archetype guidance before a speaking engagement. The faster you can find it, the more often you'll use it.

**What you'll see:** A navigation sidebar, section search, and breadcrumb bar built into the report interface.
