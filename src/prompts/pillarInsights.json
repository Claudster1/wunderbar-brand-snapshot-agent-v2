      "excellent": "Your positioning is crystal clear and differentiated. You know exactly what makes you unique, and that clarity is likely showing up in how customers perceive and choose you. To maintain this strength, consider how you can deepen your positioning as you scale—Snapshot+ can help you map out positioning strategies for new markets or product lines.",
      "strong": "You have a solid foundation for positioning. You understand what sets you apart, and that's a real advantage. The next step is ensuring this positioning consistently shows up across every touchpoint—your website, sales conversations, and marketing materials. Snapshot+ will show you exactly where to reinforce this positioning for maximum impact.",
      "developing": "You're building toward a clearer positioning, which is great. The key now is to get more specific about what makes you different and who you're truly best for. When positioning feels generic, it's harder for customers to choose you over competitors. Snapshot+ includes a positioning framework that will help you sharpen this quickly.",
      "needs_focus": "Positioning is your foundation—when it's unclear, everything else becomes harder. The good news is that clarifying your positioning doesn't require a complete rebrand. Start by answering: What problem do you solve uniquely, and for whom? Snapshot+ will guide you through a positioning exercise that transforms clarity into competitive advantage.",
      "modifiers": {
        "no_website": "Without a website, it's harder for people to understand your positioning at first glance. Consider adding a clear value proposition on your homepage that immediately communicates what makes you different.",
        "unclear_differentiation": "When you're not sure what makes you different, customers won't be either. Take time to identify your unique angle—it's often the thing you do naturally that others don't.",
        "industry_competitive": "In a competitive industry, positioning becomes even more critical. Focus on a specific niche or angle rather than trying to appeal to everyone.",
        "strong_competitor_awareness": "Knowing your competitors well is a strategic advantage. Use that knowledge to position yourself in a way that highlights what you do better or differently.",
        "brand_feeling_defined": "Having a clear sense of how you want people to feel about your brand is powerful. Make sure that feeling is reflected in every message and interaction.",
        "problem_solve_clear": "When you clearly articulate the problem you solve and for whom, positioning becomes much easier. This clarity should be front and center in all your communications."

    "messaging": {
      "excellent": "Your messaging is sharp, consistent, and immediately understandable. People 'get' what you do without needing explanation, which is a huge competitive advantage. To elevate this further, consider how your messaging can evolve as you grow—Snapshot+ includes messaging frameworks for new audiences and product launches.",
      "strong": "Your messaging is clear and mostly consistent, which means customers aren't confused about what you do. The opportunity now is to make your messaging even more compelling by focusing on outcomes and benefits, not just features. Snapshot+ will show you how to refine your messaging for maximum impact.",
      "developing": "Your messaging is getting there, but there's room to make it more consistent and compelling. When messaging varies across touchpoints, it dilutes your brand's clarity. The key is to create a core message that works everywhere, then adapt it for different contexts. Snapshot+ includes messaging templates that make this easy.",
      "needs_focus": "Messaging clarity is essential—when people don't immediately understand what you do, they move on. Start by creating a simple, clear statement that anyone can understand in 30 seconds. Then use that as your foundation everywhere. Snapshot+ will help you craft messaging that converts confusion into clarity.",
      "modifiers": {
        "no_elevator_pitch": "An elevator pitch isn't just for networking—it's the foundation of all your messaging. When you can explain what you do in 30 seconds, every other message becomes easier to write.",
        "tone_inconsistent": "If your tone varies wildly across channels, it can confuse customers about who you really are. Choose a consistent tone that matches your brand personality, then apply it everywhere.",
        "messaging_inconsistent": "Inconsistent messaging makes your brand feel scattered. Create one core message, then adapt it for different contexts—same foundation, different expressions.",
        "customers_dont_get_it": "If people need explanation to understand what you do, your messaging needs work. The best messaging is so clear that it feels obvious once you hear it.",
        "tone_well_defined": "Having a clear tone of voice is powerful—it makes your messaging feel authentic and memorable. Make sure that tone shows up consistently across all your communications.",
        "messaging_consistent": "Consistent messaging builds trust and recognition. When customers see the same core message everywhere, they understand your brand faster and remember it longer."

To scale this further, Snapshot+ can help you identify which channels are driving the most value and where to double down.",
      "strong": "You're building visibility, which is great. You're active on the channels that matter, and you're publishing content regularly.

Snapshot+ includes a content strategy framework that will help you maximize every piece you publish.",
      "developing": "You're starting to build visibility, which is the right direction. The challenge is consistency—sporadic publishing makes it harder for people to find and remember you.

      "needs_focus": "Visibility is how people discover you—without it, even the best brand can struggle to grow. The good news is that you don't need to be everywhere at once.

      "modifiers": {
        "no_content_system": "Without a content system, publishing feels chaotic and inconsistent. Even a simple schedule—like one blog post or social update per week—makes a huge difference in visibility.",

        "active_on_multiple_channels": "Being active on multiple channels is smart, but make sure you're not spreading yourself too thin. Focus on the channels where your ideal customers actually spend time.",

        "no_email_list": "An email list gives you direct access to your audience, independent of algorithm changes. Consider starting one, even if it's small—it's one of the most valuable assets you can build."

Snapshot+ includes a credibility audit that will help you showcase trust signals more effectively.",
      "developing": "You're starting to build credibility, which is the right direction.

Consider adding testimonials, case studies, or examples of your work to your website. Snapshot+ will guide you through creating credibility assets that convert visitors into customers.",
      "needs_focus": "Credibility is the bridge between awareness and action—without it, people hesitate to engage. The good news is that credibility can be built quickly.

Snapshot+ includes conversion optimization strategies that will help you turn more visitors into customers.",
      "developing": "You're building your conversion foundation, which is important. The challenge is clarity—when visitors aren't sure what the next step is, they often leave without taking action. Make sure your website has clear, prominent calls-to-action that guide visitors toward engagement. Snapshot+ will show you how to create a conversion path that feels natural and compelling.",
      "needs_focus": "Conversion is where interest becomes action—without clear next steps, visitors often leave without engaging. The good news is that conversion can be improved quickly. Start by adding clear calls-to-action to your website, then create a simple lead magnet or form to capture interest. Snapshot+ includes conversion frameworks that will help you turn visitors into leads and leads into customers.",
      "modifiers": {
        "clear_ctas": "Clear calls-to-action guide visitors toward action. Make sure your CTAs are prominent, specific, and tell visitors exactly what happens when they click.",
