  "pillarInsights": {
    "positioning": {
      "excellent": "Your positioning is clear, differentiated, and immediately understandable — which means the right customers are self-selecting with confidence and the wrong ones are filtering out early. This is a genuine competitive advantage that compounds over time. The strategic priority is ensuring this clarity holds as you scale into new markets, channels, or product lines.",
      "strong": "You have a solid positioning foundation — you understand what sets you apart, and that shows up in how customers perceive you. The opportunity is tightening the gap between how you describe yourself internally and how the market experiences you externally. When every touchpoint tells the same story, customer acquisition cost drops measurably.",
      "developing": "Your positioning has promising elements but lacks the specificity needed for the market to understand why you — specifically — are the right choice. When positioning feels interchangeable with competitors, customers default to price or familiarity. The most valuable next step is defining a single, defensible value proposition that passes the 'so what' test.",
      "needs_focus": "Positioning is the strategic foundation everything else builds on — when it's unclear, messaging, visibility, credibility, and conversion all underperform simultaneously. The good news: clarifying positioning doesn't require a rebrand. It requires answering one question with precision: what problem do you solve uniquely, and for whom? That answer becomes the lens for every decision that follows.",
      "modifiers": {
        "no_website": "Without a web presence, your positioning exists only in conversations — which limits how consistently and broadly it reaches your market. A clear value proposition on a homepage creates the anchor point everything else references.",
        "unclear_differentiation": "When differentiation is unclear, the market treats you as interchangeable — which compresses margin and extends sales cycles. Identify the one thing you do that competitors either can't or won't replicate.",
        "industry_competitive": "In a competitive market, generic positioning is invisible positioning. The brands that grow fastest are the ones that define a specific, ownable niche rather than competing for the broadest possible audience.",
        "strong_competitor_awareness": "Competitor awareness is a strategic asset. Use it to identify the white space in your market — the position that's valuable to customers but unoccupied by incumbents.",
        "brand_feeling_defined": "Having clarity on how you want people to feel about your brand is a strong foundation for positioning. The next step is ensuring that feeling is consistently expressed across every touchpoint.",
        "problem_solve_clear": "Clearly articulating the problem you solve and for whom is the single most valuable positioning asset. Make it the first thing anyone sees when they encounter your brand."
      }
    },
    "messaging": {
      "excellent": "Your messaging is sharp, consistent, and immediately clear — people understand what you do without needing explanation, which is a significant competitive advantage. Each interaction builds on the last, compounding recognition and trust. The strategic focus should be on evolving this messaging system as your audience or market shifts.",
      "strong": "Your messaging is clear and mostly consistent, which means customers aren't confused about what you offer. The opportunity is moving from 'clear' to 'compelling' — shifting language from features and capabilities to outcomes and transformations that resonate emotionally with your target audience.",
      "developing": "Your messaging has strong instincts but lacks a codified system — which means it shifts depending on the channel, the moment, or who's writing. This inconsistency prevents trust from compounding. The highest-leverage move is creating one core narrative and three messaging pillars that anchor every piece of communication.",
      "needs_focus": "Messaging clarity is a revenue lever — when people don't immediately understand what you do and why it matters, they move on to a competitor whose message they can grasp. The fix starts with one clear sentence: who you serve, what you do, and why it matters. Build everything else from there.",
      "modifiers": {
        "no_elevator_pitch": "Without a codified core message, every new interaction requires the brand to be re-explained from scratch. A clear 15-word value proposition becomes the anchor for every other piece of communication.",
        "tone_inconsistent": "Inconsistent tone across channels creates a subtle but measurable trust deficit — people can't quite place who you are. Defining 3–5 voice traits with examples makes consistency achievable even across teams.",
        "messaging_inconsistent": "Inconsistent messaging means each touchpoint starts from zero instead of building on previous interactions. One master narrative with channel-specific adaptations solves this without making everything sound the same.",
        "customers_dont_get_it": "If people need explanation to understand your value, the messaging — not the offering — is the bottleneck. The best messaging feels obvious in hindsight.",
        "tone_well_defined": "A clear, consistent tone is a brand asset that compounds — it makes your messaging feel authentic and memorable. Ensure it shows up in every channel, not just the ones you personally control.",
        "messaging_consistent": "Consistent messaging builds cumulative recognition. Each interaction reinforces the last, which shortens the path from awareness to trust."
      }
    },
    "visibility": {
      "excellent": "Your visibility strategy is working — you're discoverable across multiple channels, publishing consistently, and building the kind of presence that makes organic discovery sustainable. The strategic priority is optimizing for efficiency (which channels drive the most value) and ensuring you're positioned for AI-powered discovery as search behavior shifts.",
      "strong": "You're building visibility on the right channels with regular content. The opportunity is making this presence more strategic — ensuring every piece of content supports your positioning and that you're discoverable not just through traditional search but through AI-powered platforms that are reshaping how people find brands.",
      "developing": "You're building visibility, but gaps in consistency and channel coverage mean your brand isn't appearing where high-intent buyers are searching. The most common pattern: inconsistent publishing that prevents the cumulative visibility that drives organic growth. A sustainable cadence on 2–3 channels will compound faster than sporadic activity across many.",
      "needs_focus": "Visibility is distribution for your brand — without it, positioning, messaging, and credibility never reach the people who would value them most. The starting point is identifying the 2–3 channels where your ideal customers actually spend time, then showing up consistently there. As AI search grows, optimizing for both traditional SEO and Answer Engine Optimization is becoming critical for long-term discoverability.",
      "modifiers": {
        "no_content_system": "Without a content system, publishing is reactive and inconsistent. Even a minimal weekly cadence on one platform builds more cumulative visibility than sporadic bursts across many.",
        "sporadic_publishing": "Inconsistent publishing prevents the cumulative effect that drives organic visibility. Consistency matters more than volume — a sustainable rhythm on one channel outperforms sporadic activity across five.",
        "active_on_multiple_channels": "Multi-channel presence is a strength, provided each channel is getting enough attention to build momentum. Audit which channels are driving real discovery versus just occupying space.",
        "email_list_active": "An active email list is one of the most valuable visibility assets — it's a direct line to your audience that isn't subject to algorithm changes or platform shifts.",
        "email_campaigns_regular": "Regular email communication keeps your brand top-of-mind in the one channel you fully own. This consistency builds a relationship that paid channels can't replicate.",
        "content_types_diverse": "Content diversity across formats (written, video, audio) extends reach to different audience preferences. Ensure each format reinforces the same positioning and messaging.",
        "no_email_list": "An email list is the only discovery channel you fully own — independent of algorithm changes, platform policies, and ad costs. Building one, even starting small, is a high-priority infrastructure investment."
      }
    },
    "credibility": {
      "excellent": "Your credibility infrastructure is strong — social proof, demonstrated expertise, and visual consistency all reinforce trust. This makes every other pillar work harder because prospects arrive already inclined to believe you. The focus should be on refreshing proof points regularly and expanding into new forms of authority (thought leadership, original research, industry recognition).",
      "strong": "You're building credibility with real proof points and consistent presentation. The opportunity is strategic placement — ensuring your strongest trust signals appear at the exact moments prospects are making buying decisions, not buried on a page nobody visits.",
      "developing": "You have credibility markers but they're not visible enough or consistent enough to do their job. When proof points exist but aren't strategically deployed, prospects make decisions without the evidence that would tip them in your favor. The most impactful move is placing your 3 strongest proof points where buying decisions happen.",
      "needs_focus": "Credibility is the bridge between interest and action — without visible trust signals, qualified prospects default to safer, more established alternatives even when your offering is superior. Start with the basics: 3–5 outcome-specific testimonials, consistent visual presentation, and one detailed case study that demonstrates your methodology and results.",
      "modifiers": {
        "has_testimonials": "Testimonials are a high-value credibility asset. The strategic question is placement — are they at the decision points where prospects hesitate, or buried on a page that gets minimal traffic?",
        "has_case_studies": "Case studies are among the most persuasive trust signals, particularly for B2B. Ensure they're prominently featured and structured around outcomes, not just process.",
        "work_examples_visible": "Visible examples of your work build trust faster than any claim. The goal is making them impossible to miss during the evaluation process.",
        "no_social_proof": "Without social proof, every new prospect has to take a leap of faith. Even 3 strong testimonials, strategically placed, can measurably reduce this trust gap.",
        "awards_or_press": "Awards and press mentions are third-party credibility signals that carry disproportionate weight because they can't be manufactured. Feature them prominently.",
        "results_visible": "Concrete, quantifiable results are the strongest form of credibility. When prospects can see specific outcomes you've delivered, the conversation shifts from 'can they do this?' to 'how do we start?'"
      }
    },
    "conversion": {
      "excellent": "Your conversion infrastructure is well-built — clear CTAs, defined next steps, and systems to capture and nurture leads. This means the attention your brand generates efficiently becomes revenue. The focus should be on optimization: testing variants, refining micro-conversions, and ensuring the system scales with increasing traffic.",
      "strong": "You have a solid conversion setup with clear calls-to-action and defined next steps. The opportunity is reducing friction at the margins — the small drop-off points between interest and action that compound into meaningful lost revenue at scale.",
      "developing": "Your conversion path has the basic elements but lacks the cohesion needed to guide prospects confidently from interest to action. When visitors aren't sure what to do next, they leave — and most won't come back. The single most impactful fix: one clear, prominent CTA on every page that removes ambiguity about the next step.",
      "needs_focus": "Conversion infrastructure is where every upstream investment either compounds into revenue or leaks out through unclear next steps. Without clear CTAs, lead capture, and follow-up systems, growth depends on luck rather than design. Start with the fundamentals: one primary CTA per page, a basic lead capture mechanism, and a simple follow-up sequence.",
      "modifiers": {
        "clear_ctas": "Clear calls-to-action are a conversion fundamental. Ensure each CTA is specific about what happens next — ambiguous buttons ('Learn More') convert at significantly lower rates than specific ones ('Get Your Free Assessment').",
        "next_step_obvious": "When the next step is self-evident, conversion happens naturally. This clarity is a design problem, not a sales problem — make the desired action the most visually prominent element on every page.",
        "has_lead_magnets": "Lead magnets create a natural value exchange that builds your audience while demonstrating expertise. Ensure they're aligned with your positioning — the right lead magnet attracts the right prospects.",
        "has_nurture_sequences": "Nurture sequences are critical for leads that aren't ready to buy immediately. The brands that maintain consistent, valuable follow-up capture revenue that impulsive-only funnels miss.",
        "no_ctas": "Without calls-to-action, visitors have to figure out how to engage with your brand on their own — and most won't bother. Adding a single, clear CTA to every page is likely the fastest conversion improvement available.",
        "next_step_unclear": "When the next step is ambiguous, prospects default to inaction. Audit every page with one question: is there exactly one thing I want a visitor to do here? If the answer isn't immediately obvious, that's the fix.",
        "no_lead_capture": "Without lead capture, every visitor who isn't ready to buy immediately is a lost opportunity with no way to follow up. Even a simple email opt-in creates a contactable audience you can nurture over time."
